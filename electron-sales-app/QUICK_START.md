## Tips & Tricks

### üí° Tip 1: Stock Warnings
When adding items to invoice, if quantity > available stock, you'll see a warning. You can still proceed if needed (e.g., for backorders).

### üí° Tip 2: Invoice IDs
Invoice IDs are auto-generated: `INV-YYYYMMDD-XXX`
- Example: `INV-20251027-001`
- Unique and sortable

### üí° Tip 3: Automatic Backups
Every time you save, a backup is created:
- Location: Same folder as Excel file
- Format: `filename.TIMESTAMP.bak.xlsx`
- Keeps last 5 backups

### üí° Tip 4: Search Everything
All tables have search functionality:
- Products: Search by name
- Customers: Search by name, email, or phone
- Invoices: Visible in table

### üí° Tip 5: Excel Integration
The Excel file is the single source of truth:
- You can edit it directly in Excel
- Click refresh (üîÑ) to reload changes
- Don't have both open simultaneously
